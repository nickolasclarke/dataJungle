## Model Input - Storage Control Algorithm Parameters & GHG Reduction Solutions

# Storage Control Algorithms:
#
#  * "OSESMO Economic Dispatch" - a linear-program-based optimal control
#  strategy where the battery is dispatched so as to minimize the customer bill
#  savings while avoiding excessive battery cycling, and can co-optimize
#  for GHG reductions as well.
#
#  * "OSESMO Non-Economic Solar Self-Supply" - intended for customers on a
#  flat/tiered rate with solar plus storage, where there is no economic
#  incentive for the battery to dispatch. This dispatch mode adds
#  additional cost terms (P_PV(t) - P_ES_in(t)) to be minimized, which
#  represent all power produced by the PV system that is not stored in the
#  battery. The battery will still respond to economic signals when in this
#  mode (such as a tiered rate with SmartRate critical peak pricing), but
#  is not guaranteed to effectively reduce customer bills when in this mode.
#  The cycling penalty is also set to $0/equivalent cycle in this mode.

# Storage Control Algorithm Name
Storage_Control_Algorithm_Name = "OSESMO Economic Dispatch"

# GHG Reduction Solutions Reduction Strategies:
#
#  * "No GHG Reduction Solution" - Carbon price is set to $0/metric ton,
#    battery is dispatched purely to maximize customer bill savings.
#
#  * "GHG Signal Co-Optimization" - Carbon price is set to a nonzero value,
#    and the of battery is dispatched to co-optimize for both bill savings and
#    GHG reduction. Potential carbon price values include:
#        * $1/metric ton - arbitrarily low nonzero number
#        * $15/metric ton - current auction price
#        * $65/metric ton - current APCR price
#
#  * "No-Charging Time Constraint" - following a subset of PG&E"s
#    recommendation, charging cannot occur between 4:00 pm and 9:00 pm.
#    Carbon price is set to $0/metric ton.
#
#  * "Charging and Discharging Time Constraints" - following PG&E"s
#    recommendation, at least 50# of charging must occur between
#    9:00 am and 2:00 pm, and at least 50# of discharging must occur
#    between 4:00 pm and 9:00 pm. Charging cannot occur between 4:00 pm and 9:00 pm.
#    Carbon price is set to $0/metric ton.

#  * "IOU-Proposed Charge-Discharge Time Constraints" - following the Joint
#    IOU recommendation, at least 50# of charging must occur between
#    12:00 pm and 4:00 pm, and at least 50# of discharging must occur
#    between 4:00 pm and 9:00 pm. Carbon price is set to $0/metric ton.
#
#  * "Non-Positive GHG Constraint" - model is constrained to prevent
#    positive emissions. Note that due to the model structure, this
#    constraint is applied on a monthly basis. Carbon price is set to $0/metric ton.
